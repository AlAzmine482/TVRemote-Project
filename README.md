 This project aims to showcase our intermediate knowledge of C#. The project’s goal is to
 simulate the behavior of a TV remote and its relationship to the TV. The requirements are the
 power button, channels, mute, volume, smart menu, and settings functionality. Using the Console
 Application to simulate the interactions of the Remote and TV screen. In the project, I’ve used
 inheritance, Base, Abstract classes, Access Modifiers, Methods, Fields, Constructors, Getters,
 Setters, and Properties. I designed the project where the TvDevice abstract class is used for
 Tvmodels classes to represent the supported Tvs of the Remote. If the TV isn’t the supported TV
 Model it will return a message “TVModel is not supported”. Otherwise the remote will show the
 menu of the remote and features the remote can do. I didn’t want the TV remote to operate if the
 model wasn’t appropriately supported. The remote menu consists of a few functions that call
 models respected methods. I wanted the properties to be simple so I can keep track of them and
 for the sake of simplicity. The challenges I’ve encountered while working on this project is
 breaking it down into each class, how would the remote interact with the TV, what kind of values
 would I return, and how would I explain these functions to someone without a background in CS.
 There were moments when I was confused throughout the project
